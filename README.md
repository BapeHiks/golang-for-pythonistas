# Golang for Pythonistas

Advanced topics for [Python programmers](https://www.python.org/) looking to use [Go](http://golang.org/).

### FAQ

*Why "Golang" instead of "Go"?*

I use both names interchangeably, but I prefer to use "Golang" in titles and project names - especially those involving multiple languages - to reduce the chance of a name collision.

*Haven't I seen this project before?*

You have. There are multiple introductions to Go for Python programmers. However, many have been abandoned and most only skimmed the surface of the language (concurrency being the common exception!), though some great material has been produced:

- [Go for Pythonistas](https://talks.golang.org/2013/go4python.slide)
- [Go and the Zen of Python](http://talks.golang.org/2012/zen.slide)
- [GO for Python Programmers (video)](https://youtu.be/LPALFhMyVoQ?t=3m9s)
- [Go for Python Programmers](https://golang-for-python-programmers.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

* What's your background?

I have being writing Python since 2008 and Go since 2011. I mainly write web services, which I formerly did in Python and now do in Go. I still use python for scripting, data science, and data munging.
